pig is composed of two major parts:
1- high level data flow language: Pig Latin
2- an engin that parses, optimizes, and executes ht ePig latin Scripts as a series of MapReduce jobs that run on a Hadoop cluster.
compared to java MapReduce, is easier to write, understand and maintain.
Pig is highly extensible through User Defined Functions (UDF) which allow custom processing to be written in many languages such as Python.
After data is processed in HDFS it can be stored bck into HDFS.

We can write a pig script in a *.pig file and run it from commandline locally or on cluster:

comment symbol in  pig script is: --
running pig from commandline locally:
$pig  -x local wcount.pig 
on cluster:
pig -x mapreduce wcount.pig

saving log data such as Describe, dump results into a log:
$pig -x local wcount.pig > wcount.log
 each line in the script should finish with semicolon!
#some comments on load statement:
load '/home/cloudera/pig_n_python/' USING PigStorange('\n') AS (linesin:chararray);
1- the default loading function is PigStorage with Default delimiter: \t.
2- USING and loader are optional and if ommited it defaults to PigStorage and \t delimiter.
3- AS allows to define fields and filed types. any field not defined defaults to bite array.
4- say each input has 4 field and we define two, thus two named field we have and two positional fields defaulted to bytearray.

example of filter: we can use AND, OR, and NOT as well!!
r = FILTER student BY age>=20;

store:
if the output directory exitst, the store operator will fail.
add: fs -rmr home/cloudera/output/ 
at the begining of the script to remove the output folder and does not fail!
#no quotation si required since it is a shell command!
good for re-running the script several times.
