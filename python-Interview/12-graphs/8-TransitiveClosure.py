'''
Given a directed graph, find out if a vertex v is reachable from another vertex u for all vertex pairs (u, v)
 in the given graph. Here reachable means that there is a path from vertex u to v.
 The reach-ability matrix is called transitive closure of a graph.

 1. Create a matrix tc[V][V] that would finally have transitive closure of given graph.
     Initialize all entries of tc[][] as 0.
Call DFS for every node of graph to mark reachable vertices in tc[][].
In recursive calls to DFS, we donâ€™t call DFS for an adjacent vertex if it is already marked as reachable in tc[][].
