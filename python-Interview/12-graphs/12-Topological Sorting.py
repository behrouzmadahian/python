Topological sorting for Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a linear ordering of
vertices such that for every directed edge uv, vertex u comes before v in the ordering.
 Topological Sorting for a graph is not possible if the graph is not a DAG.
 There can be more than one topological sorting for a graph!
The first vertex in topological sorting is always a vertex with in-degree as 0
(a vertex with no in-coming edges).
In DFS, we print a vertex and then recursively call DFS for its adjacent vertices.
In topological sorting, we need to print a vertex before its adjacent vertices.
In topological sorting, we use a temporary stack. We donâ€™t print the vertex immediately,
we first recursively call topological sorting for all its adjacent vertices,
then push it to a stack. Finally, print contents of stack. Note that a vertex
is pushed to stack only when all of its adjacent vertices
(and their adjacent vertices and so on) are already in stack.
