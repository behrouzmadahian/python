- We can save the model + optimizer state (SavedModel or h5 format

- Before saving the model, reset the model metrics- this way model before and after loading will have
the same state(starting at ZERO)

Saving whole model:
- You can save a model built with the functional API into a single file. 
- you can later recreate the samne model from this file, even if you no longer have access to the
code that created the model. This file includes:

- The Model's architecutre
- The model's weight values
- The model's training config (what you passed to compile) if any
- The optimizer and its state if any (this enables you to restart training where you left)

Export to SavedModel format
You can also export a whole model to tensorflow SavedModel format.
SavedM<odel is a standalone serialization format for Tensorflow objects
supported by tensorflow serving as well as tensorflow implementations other than Python

The SavedModel files that were created contain:
- A Tensorflow checkpoint containing the model weights
- A SavedModel proto contaning the underlying tensorflow graph
